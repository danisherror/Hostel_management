### ðŸš€ Hostel Management System (MongoDB, React, Node.js, Express.js, JWT, Charts/Graphs)

* Developed a **full-stack hostel management platform** providing students, wardens, and admins with role-based access and functionality.
* Built **student portal** for room booking, room change requests, complaint submission, leave applications, feedback, announcements, and **QR codeâ€“based check-in/out tracking with timestamps**.
* Implemented **admin dashboard** to manage hostels, assign/remove wardens, create/edit/delete rooms, handle complaints/feedback/leave requests, and view **analytics via charts/graphs** (complaints resolved, student occupancy, live in/out status).
* Designed **warden panel** with hostel-specific data access to monitor student complaints, leaves, and activities.
* Integrated **dark/light mode UI** for accessibility and user-friendly experience.
* Utilized **JWT authentication & authorization** for secure login and role-based access control.
* Leveraged **MongoDB for scalable data storage**, **React for responsive frontend**, and **Express.js/Node.js for backend APIs**.
